NAVIGATION MENUS APP

When am developing a webapp i always enjoy doing the other parts but dread when i realised i have to do the navigation. I am like the worst if it comes to this and i realised maybe i should turn my fear of nav bars to a lesson.  

AIM OF THE PROJECT 

The main aim of the project is to help me improve my skills in navigation Using javascript. I am not claiming pure html and css only is easy but there is so much articles and references for that but for javascript its limiting. 
Something else is that js has being my weakpoint if it comes to frontend and if i do this it will help me practice tht to.
